## Description

This application uses a inquire npm package to ask the user a series of question in the terminal. Once the user answers all the question a readme will be generated.

## Usage

The user must go through the question sequential. Where there are multiple choice questions, the user must choose one. Where there are open input questions the user must fill in the open response. Leaving the space blank will simply leave that portion of teh readme page blank. When putting inputting a list of responses, keep that list of responses on that same question.
For a new line format line so.
'input/input' is the indecator for a new line
'/1. input' is the indecator for a new line with a number
This output is written like this:1. First line/2. Second line

1. First line
2. Second line
